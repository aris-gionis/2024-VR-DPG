Diversity in Information Systems (DIVIS)
Diversity and Fairness in Information Systems (DIFIS) 


POINTS

Highlight differences and connections of diversity and fairness 

Diversity and fairness in knowledge exploration  -- DiF-IE
-- diversity in ranking systems (MSR)
-- incorporate user modeling
-- papers with Erica / Honglian / Sijing
-- reinforcement learning (Ruo-Chun)
-- user modeling with ALPS 
-- max-sum diversification with ALPS (?)
-- ranking : diversification over all prefixes (problem proposed to Honglian and Sijing)
-- Project with Tianyi
	o  Hitting set + calibration (should probably go in connection to user modeling)

Diversity and fairness in Information Networks -- DiF-IN
-- republik / minimize exposure
-- introduce new notions of diversity in graphs
-- fairness-aware pagerank (Haoyun Zhou project)
-- florian reduce diameter problem, but with colors / fairness 
-- Add edges to improve information access (problem with Ece and Carlo?)
-- local changes
-- diversity densest subgraphs


Diversity and Fairness in Information markets -- DiF-IM
-- diversity in scenarios where supply meets demand


Diversity-aware and fair clustering -- DiF-C

Interesting method to explore --> ALPS
-- for what problem exactly?
-- for instance in conjuntion with user modeling, to predict user responses


Other interesting topics / papers:

-- Clustering with fair outliers (!) Epasto
-- Maxmin-Fair Ranking: Individual Fairness under Group-Fairness Constraints (Garc√≠a-Soriano and Bonchi)
-- Graph Augmentation for Equitable Access (GAEA),
-- Information access representations and social capital in networks (Suresh)
-- Max-Min Diversification with Fairness Constraints: Exact and Approximation Algorithms (Mathioudakis)
-- Diversity in market systems -- DivMS
	o  diversity in scenarios where supply meets demand
	o  there should be work by economists
