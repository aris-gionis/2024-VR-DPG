This project does not involve sex and gender perspectives, as described in the instructions provided by the Swedish Research Council. For example, we do not indent to analyze differences between women and men, nor do we indent to study how gender affiliations are created and understood.

It is worth noting that in the project we adopt an abstract view of diversity and fairness, and those can be defined with respect any any underlying attribute, or set of attributes, or even generic distance functions. For example, when recommending movies to an individual, diversity could be defined with respect to the movie genre (comedy, drama, mystery, etc.), or with respect to the country of origin. On the other hand, naturally, diversity could also be defined with respect to gender-related attributes, e.g., the gender of the movie director. Our methods will be applicable to a broad range of cases, where diversity and fairness are defined appropriately for the intended application.
