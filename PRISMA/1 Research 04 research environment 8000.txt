The project will employ three doctoral students for five years each (working 80% in research and 20% as teaching assistants, as it is typical in KTH), and three postdoctoral researchers for two years each. The PI will devote 50% of his time in the project. 

We will organize the team so that a pair of a doctoral student and a postdoc will work on the same research theme. In this way, we expect the postdoc to act as a mentor for the doctoral student, in addition to the postdoc pursuing their own research agenda. Furthermore, we will encourage collaborations among team members from different research themes, to bring synergies and allow for transfer of knowledge and expertise. We will however, ensure that each team member has a well-defined research project, with clear objectives to graduation (for the doctoral students) or to career development goals (for the postdocs). We will encourage an environment of openness, and will pursue collaborations with other researchers who have expertise on specific areas, either within KTH, or from abroad, taking advantage of our international network. We will encourage the research team to pursue research visits and internships abroad or attend international summer schools (subject of course to their personal preferences and constraints) and we will invite other researchers for visits or seminars to KTH. 

The PI will supervise the doctoral students and postdocs, be responsible for scientific lead, and will allocate time to work on concrete mathematical and algorithmic problems. He will be responsible for ensuring flow of information and collaborations with other groups in KTH and his international collaboration network. He will be holding weekly one-to-one meetings with all the team members. In addition, the team will have weekly group meetings with varying agenda, ranging from brainstorming to reporting progress on specific problems, and from dry-run presentations to journal clubs.
The PI is currently managing an ERC Advanced Grant (2020 to 2025), which also employs 3 doctoral students and 3 postdocs, so this will be a smooth transition to a similar-sized project.

As the PI is a WASP professor in KTH, the doctoral students who will be recruited in the project will join the WASP doctoral education network, and they will benefit immensely from its courses, events, connections with industry, and networking with other doctoral students all over Sweden. Similarly, the PI is an active faculty member in the Digital Futures research center, and all the team members will have many opportunities to participate in Digital Futures activities, such as seminar series, workshops, opportunities for multi-disciplinary collaborations, etc.

During the hiring process we will support diversity and consider actions to achieve gender balance, which we believe will promote the gender balance in KTH overall. Currently the PI supervises 6 doctoral students and the gender ratio is 3f:3f. In addition, currently there are 5 postdocs in the team and the gender ratio is 2f:3m.
