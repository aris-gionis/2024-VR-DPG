In this project we will develop novel computational methods for searching and exploring large amounts of data in modern information-access systems. Our methods will empower individuals to find information that caters for their needs, whether those are for education, entertainment, or decision-making purposes, while maximizing diversity of information and ensuring fairness of the presented content. Incorporating these principles into information-seeking methods helps mitigating biases and avoiding blind spots, which are created by machine-learning methods that often aim to maximize solely user satisfaction or user engagement. Among different types of information systems we will focus on three domains: information-exploration systems, information networks, and two-sided information markets. 

The project has foundational nature and aims to establish a unified framework and common methodologies for studying diversity and fairness in the different settings. Potential breakthroughs include introducing novel models, applying novel computational approaches to these problems, and developing methods with theoretical guarantees. The project will employ three PhD students and three two-year postdocs, in addition to 50% time allocated by the PI. The project also aims to consolidate research on the foundations of data science in the computer-science department of KTH and create an internationally prominent hub in this field.
