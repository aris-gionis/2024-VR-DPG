\section{{\small RESEARCH EXPERIENCE}}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
\item[]
My research focuses on data mining and algorithmic data analysis.
I am particular interested in algorithms for graphs, social-network analysis, and algorithms for web-scale data. 
I have worked on a wide variety of problems, 
and this diversity is reflected on my publication record. 

My background puts me in a unique position 
to complete the proposed project successfully. 
I have carried the\-ore\-ti\-cal work on algorithms design,
and I have experience on practical data-mining methods, 
supported by a six-year experience in industrial research. 

I have published highly-cited work 
on a number of different areas that compose the project theme:
time-varying network analysis, 
scalable algorithms for graph mining, 
streaming and sketching techniques, 
summarization and clustering methods, 
network-inference algorithms, 
social-media and web-mining applications, etc.

\end{itemize}

\section{{\small SUPERVISING EXPERIENCE}}
\begin{itemize}
% \setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
\item[--]
Since joining Aalto in 2013,
I have been leading the Data Mining group, 
currently consisting of 5 doctoral students and 2 postdoctoral researchers. \\
Members of the group have been actively publishing in top-level journals and conferences.\\
Graduates of the group have been employed in Google, Microsoft, Bell Labs, 
EPFL (postdoc), MIT (postdoc), and University of Helsinki (assistant professor).\\
All doctoral students have been conducting internship in places
such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, LinkedIn, Nokia, and MPI.

\item[--]
While in Yahoo!\ Research, 
I supervised more than 10 PhD interns. 
The typical internship duration was 3 months, 
and almost all internships led to at least one publication at a top-tier venue.
%% With many students I continued working from distance after they finished their internship.
\end{itemize}


\section{{\small INDUSTRIAL EXPERIENCE}}
\begin{itemize}
% \setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
\item[]
During my appointment in Yahoo!\ Research, I have been the manager of the Web Mining group. 
My position involved scientific lead, 
tech transfer, 
managing the group activities, 
and administrative duties.
\end{itemize}
