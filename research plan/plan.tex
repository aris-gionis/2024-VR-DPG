\subsection*{1.~~~Purpose and aims}

In the modern information age we are submersed in a constant stream of data from various sources, 
ranging from the internet and social media to news outlets and podcasts. 
While this wealth of information has the potential to empower individuals, 
it also poses a significant challenge known as \emph{information~overload}:
as the volume of available information continues to grow exponentially, 
individuals are increasingly struggling to sift through noisy data
to find reliable, relevant, and meaningful~content.

\iffalse
This overload can lead to decision paralysis, reduced productivity, and cognitive overload, ultimately hindering our ability to make informed decisions and engage critically with the world around us. Addressing the problem of information overload requires not only technological solutions such as improved search algorithms and filtering mechanisms but also a concerted effort to cultivate digital literacy skills and promote mindful consumption habits among individuals.
\fi 

To mitigate the problem of information overload, 
in addition to cultivating % digital literacy skills and promoting 
mindful consumption habits, 
it also requires \emph{technological solutions} tailored to the needs of individuals. 
Advanced information-retrieval algorithms can help streamline search processes, 
enabling users to find relevant content. 
%  more efficiently amidst vast data pools. 
Recommendation systems play a crucial role by suggesting personalized content 
based on users' preferences and past interactions. 
The challenge of information overload arises in various scenarios. 
For instance, it occurs when users interact with search engines using keyword searches, 
when peruse product reviews, 
scroll through social-media timelines, or 
receive recommendations for movies or restaurants.

%  thus reducing the burden of sifting through irrelevant information. 
% Personalization further enhances user experiences by tailoring content delivery to individual interests and behaviors, ensuring that users receive the most pertinent information. 
% By harnessing these technological tools, we can navigate the information landscape more effectively, mitigating the challenges posed by information overload and empowering individuals to make informed decisions.

When designing smart tools for infromation access, ensuring \emph{relevance} is paramount:
users expect content that aligns closely with their interests and needs.
But beyond relevance, \emph{diversity} and \emph{fairness} are equally crucial.
Diversity ensures exposure to varied perspectives, 
while fairness ensures equitable access to information.
Integrating diversity and fairness into information-access systems has numerous benefits, 
such as mitigating biases, 
helping counter filter-bubble and rabbit-hole effects, 
fostering a more inclusive and fair representation of different perspectives, and 
promoting a well-rounded understanding of topics.

While relevance, diversity, and fairness
have been extensively studied in different areas of computer science, 
including information retrieval, recommender systems, and machine learning,
their interplay remains relatively understudied.
We posit that incorporating diversity and fairness into modern information-access systems
remains an unsolved problem, 
offering ample space for fundamental research contributions.
The \acronym\ project aspires to contribute in addressing 
significant challenges in this area. 
% More concretely, the project has the following goal.

\medskip
\noindent
\hspace{-3mm}\colorbox{verylightmagenta}{
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
{\bf High-level goal of \acronym:} 
We will develop theoretical foundations and novel abstractions to 
study notions of diversity and fairness in information-access systems.
We will design algorithms for these problems with provable guarantees.
Among diffrent information-access systems we will focus on 
information-exploration systems, information networks, and two-sided information markets.
\end{minipage}}

\ag{Text below could also go to ``novelty''.}

\spara{Challenges.}
The proposed project is of theoretical nature, 
lying in the areas of information retrieval, recommender systems,  
knowledge discovery, and algorithms design. 
Achieving the project aim entails significant challenges. 
First, we need to design novel abstractions that model faithfully system entities and their interactions, 
e.g., semantic distances between content items or user behavior, 
while capturing notions of diversity and fairness and their inter-play with relevance.
Second, we will be dealing with noisy data generated by a diverse set of actors
who exhibit complex behavior and may have adversarial motives, 
thus, our methods need to be robust to such complexities.
Third, we will be confronted with challenging optimization tasks, and thus, 
we will need to develop scalable algorithms with theoretical guarantees on the solution quality.

\iffalse
\medskip
\noindent
\hspace{-3mm}\colorbox{verylightmagenta}{
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
{\bf Hypothesis:} 
We postulate that modern information-access systems suffer from lack of diversity 
and unfair representation of content. 
We hypothesize that such deficiencies can be mitigated by formulating novel abstractions
and designing rigorous computational methods to support individuals in 
maximizing diversity and improving fairness of the available content. 
\end{minipage}}
\fi

\spara{Objectives.}
Our overarching objective is to address deficiencies of modern information-access systems 
with regard to lack of diversity and unfair representation of content.
To achieve this objective we aim to consolidate existing approaches, 
including our recent and ongoing work,  
and push the state-of-the-art 
in terms of introducing novel abstractions, 
developing rigorous computational methods, and 
performing evaluations on real-world applications.
In particular, {\acronym} has the following research objectives. 
%

the foundations of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
\end{description}

\spara{Diversity vs.\ fairness.}
Diversity maximization and fairness assurance are both important considerations in machine learning.
While they share some common goals, such as promoting inclusivity and reducing discrimination, 
they address different dimensions and require distinct methodologies and techniques. 

Diversity maximization often relies on optimizing distance-based or coverage-based objectives, 
designed to ensure that the outputs generated by a system cover a wide range of perspectives
and promote heterogeneity. 
Diversity maximization is often applied in recommendation systems, search engines, 
and other decision-making systems where providing a diverse set of options or perspectives is desirable.

On the other hand, 
fairness aims to mitigate biases and ensure equitable treatment of individuals or groups.
Fairness methods are based on ensuring or optimizing fairness criteria, or post-processing techniques. 
Fairness is often studied in contexts where decisions may impact individuals or groups differently, 
and finds applications in domains such as hiring, criminal justice, and healthcare.

In this project we consider that fairness concepts can be extended to other contexts,  
beyond individuals and demographic groups. 
For instance, we can talk about fairness in the context of news recommender systems, 
asking to ensure that a set of recommender news articles represent fairly the political spectrum.
In this way, similar to diversity, we can study fairness in the context of different information-access systems. 
Note however that diversity alone does not guarantee fairness, 
and fairness considerations may extend beyond simply ensuring diversity 
in the outputs of a machine learning model.

\subsection*{2.~~~State of the art}

Maximizing diversity and promoting fairness have been studied 
extensively in different contexts in computer science, 
especially in recent times with the raising importance of \emph{responsible AI}~\cite{dignum2019responsible}.
Due to space limitations we only discuss some representative approaches, 
and their connection with this proposal.

% \spara{diversity as an optimization problem}

From the theoretical viewpoint, the literature mainly focuses on two notions of diversity: 
\emph{coverage-based diversity}, relying on \emph{submodular} coverage functions~\cite{bach2013learning} 
and \emph{pairwise dissimilarity-based} diversity, like \emph{dispersion}~\cite{hassin1997approximation}.
Researchers have also attempted to formulate \emph{axioms} of diversity and study
their implications~\cite{gollapudi2009axiomatic}. 
A particularly appealing formulation is the \emph{max-sum diversity} problem~\cite{borodin2012max},
which captures trade-off between diversity and relevance for item-selection problems.
Solutions for max-sum diversity involve \emph{combinatorial methods}~\cite{borodin2012max},
\emph{convex programming}~\cite{cevallos2016max} and 
\emph{local search}~\cite{cevallos2019improved}, among other.
Such formulations and techniques will be a basis for {\acronym}
to study extensions and improved methods. 

% \spara{diversity in recommender systems}

Diversity has also been acknowledged as a crucial component in \emph{recommender systems},
shown to improve user experience~\cite{Castells2022}, 
and thus, it has received considerable attention recently. 
% ~\cite{on_unexpectedness, improving_aggregate, evaluating_novel_recs, diversity_top_n_recs, rank_relevance}.
One of the most popular methods in \emph{information retrieval},
seeking to strike a balance between diversity and relevance, 
is the \emph{maximal marginal relevance} (MMR)~\cite{MMR}, 
while many other strategies have proposed to 
maximize some utility function that combines relevance and diversity~\cite{DUM,DPMF}.
% based on submodular functions~\cite{DUM}, probabilistic matrix factorization~\cite{DPMF},  and other.
In \acronym we aim to extend the state-of-the-art significantly, 
by incorporating models of \emph{user behavior}, 
investigating approaches based \emph{reinforcement learning}, 
and studying novel notions for \emph{fair representation} of recommended items. 

% \spara{diversity in graphs}

Diversity and fairness in graph settings is a significantly less studied area,
compared to item-selection and recommender-systems problems.
Still several ideas have been investigated, 
such as \emph{adding} or \emph{rewiring graph edges} for
\emph{reducing polarization}~\cite{adriaens2023minimizing,cinus2023rebalancing,haddadan2022reducing},
\emph{mitigating exposure to harmful content}~\cite{coupette2023reducing,fabbri2022rewiring}, 
or \emph{improving fairness for the Page\-Rank algorithm}~\cite{tsioutsiouliklis2022link}.
Extending this line of work for diversity and fairness in graphs
by introducing new models and methods
is a central goal of the \acronym project.
Finally, while there is a growing literature for content recommender systems, 
algorithmic recommendations in social media~\cite{wang2021user}, 
the study of diversity and fairness in this context is largely unexplored topic.

% \spara{fairness in ML}

The topic of bias and fairness in machine learning has received a lot of interest in the recent years, 
having spawn a large community and dedicated dissemination venues, such as the FAccT Conference. 
While many surveys and tutorials can be found online~\cite{caton2020fairness,mehrabi2021survey}, 
we note that our project is more closely related to notions of
\emph{bias and fairness in unsupervised machine learning}, 
such as 
\emph{fair clustering}~\cite{chierichetti2017fair}, 
\emph{diversity-aware clustering}~\cite{thejaswi2021diversity}, 
and \emph{fair graph mining}~\cite{dong2023fairness}.

% \spara{my work}

Notably, together with my team and research collaborators, 
we have pioneered work on many of the above topics,
including
different formulations for diversity in network analysis~\cite{adriaens2023minimizing,cinus2023rebalancing,coupette2023reducing,oettershagen2024finding}
diversity in ranking problems~\cite{zhang2022ranking}, 
as well as in data clustering~\cite{thejaswi2021diversity}.

and the impact the project may have in the short and long term. 
Describe also how the project moves forward or innovates the current research frontier.}

Maybe some comments from state of the art can be moved here, or rephrased. \\

\subsection*{4.~~~Project description}


\subsubsection*{4.1.~~~Theory and methods}

The project is structured along three {\em research themes}:
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{description}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-4pt}
\item[{\exploration}\,:] 
diversity and fairness for information exploration tasks;
\item[{\networks}\,:]
diversity and fairness in information networks; and 
\item[{\markets}\,:]
diversity and fairness in information markets.
\end{description}
\vspace{-1mm}
Each theme is characterized by a different domain
for which we are aiming to ensure criteria of diversity and fairness. 
Each domain corresponds to a distinct family of information-access systems, 
has its own unique characteristics, 
it will be modeled using different abstractions, 
and we will employ different methods and techniques for solving the corresponding 
computational tasks. 
On the other hand, connections do exist, 
for instance, common definitions for diversity and fairness will be used, 
and thus, we will seek to identify synergies between the three themes
and adopt ideas that turn out to be successful.

With respect to methods, 
emphasis will be given to combinatorial algorithms,
building on the previous work of the PI 
on developing combinatorial methods for data-analysis problems.
In particular, we will consider techniques such as 
combinatorial optimization, 
optimization of submodular functions, 
local-search methods, 
greedy algorithms, 
dynamic pro\-gram\-ming, 
linear-pro\-gram\-ming and semi\-def\-ini\-te-pro\-gram\-ming relaxations, 
primal-dual methods, convex optimization,
stochastic gradient descent, etc. 
Furthermore, we will explore ideas in new domains, 
such as 
algorithms with predictions~\cite{mitzenmacher2022algorithms} and
reinforcement learning.

Next we overview the three research themes of \acronym.


\subsubsection*{Research theme 1: Diversity and fairness for information-exploration tasks}

\iffalse
\noindent
\hspace{-3mm}\colorbox{verylightmagenta}{
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\ag{do we need a summary in a box?}
\end{minipage}}

\vspace{2mm}
\fi

We consider an information system
that stores a large collection of information items.
Users interact with the system and can access the items through various means 
such as keyword searches, recommendations, or combinations of those.
We assume that users have different interests
and the system has prior information about user interests and user behavior.
Note that this is a general setting that can be used to model different scenarios, 
for instance, web-search engines, e-commerce systems, video-sharing platforms, 
or platforms for browsing and reading news articles.
Our objective is to design methods that enable users to 
\emph{explore the available information items in the system} through their interaction.
We are interested in systems that offer items that are relevant to the user's interests, 
but also satisfy criteria of diversity and fairness of representation.

As discussed before, combining relevance with diversity is an archetypal problem
in information retrieval and recommender systems, 
and there is a plethora of methods to address it. 
However, the majority of methods assume very simplistic models;
for instance, \emph{find a set of $k$ items} 
that optimize some function that combines relevance with diversity. 
In the real world, information-exploration tasks are significantly more complex and more nuanced. 
First, items are presented to users in an order, and not as a set.
Second, users may click on some of the presented item, 
initiating a new ``round'' of exploration. 
Third, there is chance that users terminate their interaction with the system, 
based on the relevance and novelty of the presented items,
as well as the duration of the exploration session so far.

Motivated by these observations, 
we will introduce novel frameworks for information-exploration tasks
that model \emph{user behavior} and aim to optimize 
the total amount of knowledge accrued by the user during exploration, 
thus, provisioning for relevance and diversity in an intuitive manner.
In our preliminary work, we have studied a simple version 
of this problem where we ask to \emph{maximize expected diversity} 
in presence of probabilities that users may terminate the exploration task
at any given step of their interaction with the system.
Such probabilities can be estimated based on the relevance and novelty
of the items presented to them.
The problem has interesting connections to \emph{ordered Hamiltonian-path problem}, 
and under mild assumptions we are able to design approximation algorithms
with provable guarantees.
In this project we aim to devise improved methods
and extend our framework to more sophisticated user-behavior models.

Another consideration in the information-exploration theme
is to consider \emph{fair representation of content} along different dimensions. 
For example, when recommending news articles for a user, 
it is important to considering presenting more than one article from the same story
so as to ensure \emph{coverage} of different sources with respect to their \emph{political leaning}, 
as well as with respect to their \emph{stance} towards important entities in the stories. 
To infer entities and stances towards them we will use standard NLP toolboxes and large language models.
Additionally, we want to select stories that are well-align with user interests. 
This is relevant to the topic of \emph{calibrated recommendations}~\cite{wang2022improving}.
In \acronym, we will develop methods for recommendations that 
offer \emph{calibrated} as well as \emph{fairly-represented} content.
Furthermore, we will study problems that model the sequential-nature of recommendations~\cite{zhang2022ranking}.

Finally, we will study the information-exploration task using \emph{reinforcement learning}.
The idea would be to formulate the task as a bandit problem
where the reward depends on actions performed in earlier steps, 
quantifying diversity and fairness considerations. 
The problem can be cast as combinatorial multi-armed bandit~\cite{chen2013combinatorial}, 
which will be the starting point for our research. 

\subsubsection*{Research theme 2: Diversity and fairness in information networks}

In this theme we focus on information networks. 
As before, we consider a general setting, 
where networks are used to model a variety of real-world scenarios
representing entities and their relationships.
Examples include 
social networks connecting people, 
hyperlink networks linking web pages, or 
recommendation networks consisting of what-to-consume-next recommendations
in a platform like youtube.
We view networks as systems where information can be spread and content can be consumed. 
Information diffusion and content consumption in a network
is typically modeled via a dynamic process, such as a random walk, 
shortest paths, local search, etc.

We additionally assume that the network nodes are labeled according to certain attributes, 
for instance, demographic groups in social networks, 
web page categories in hyperlink networks, 
content type in recommendation networks, and so on.
As a result of the 
The node attributes coupled with the network structure may give rise to 
\emph{structural bias} being present in the network.
As an example, contacts in a social network are more likely to have similar views on a topic, 
and thus, when navigating a network one may encounter bias regarding views on that topic.
The problem of mitigating the phenomenon of structural bias in information networks is an emerging topic, 
and many recent papers have addressed related questions~\cite{fabbri2022rewiring,haddadan2022reducing}, 
including papers by the PI and his 
team~\cite{adriaens2022diameter,adriaens2023minimizing,cinus2023rebalancing,coupette2023reducing}.
Typical questions are to identify network interventions, 
such as, edge additions, re\-wirings, or re\-weightings, 
to optimize given measures of bias or polarization.

We aim to advance the state of the art in this topic
along many directions. 
First, many of the proposed techniques consider only two groups of nodes in the network, 
i.e., a single attribute with only two values.
Extending the existing methods for more than two groups, 
to account for realistic demographic scenarios or topics with multiple viewpoints, 
is a non trivial problem.
Second, while many of the existing works consider the problems of minimizing bias and polarization, 
the issues of diversity and fairness in information networks have not been studied.  
We propose to study a novel measure of diversity with respect to random-walk navigation, 
defined as the \emph{group cover time}, i.e., 
the expected time to visit at least one node of each color
in a random walk starting from a given node.
Our goal is to design network-intervention methods to 
optimize this diversity measure.

Additionally, while most methods consider random-walk navigation for information access, 
it is also interesting to study navigation models based on shortest-path distances. 
In our earlier work we studied the problem of adding edges in order to minimize the network diameter, 
with degree constraints~\cite{adriaens2022diameter}.
As our model does not consider any node attributes, 
we aim to extend the problem in settings with node attributes. 
The goal is to identify small sets of network interventions
to optimize information access among the different groups in the network.

In another direction, existing methods typically consider \emph{global interventions}, 
that is, they seek to identify a small number of interventions so as to 
optimize a global network objective. 
However, it is particularly interesting to study settings for \emph{local interventions}, 
where we aim to provide \emph{recourse actions} for a particular node of interest in the network, 
so as to optimize diversity and fairness measures for that node. 
One challenge here is to ensure such actions do not degrade 
the corresponding measures of other nodes in the~network. 
\ag{social welfare?}

Finally, in all of the previous cases it is assumed that interventions are certain, 
e.g., edges can be added with probability~1.
In some cases, interventions correspond to link recommendations, 
which are adopted with a certain probability
(which often can be estimated).
Thus, it will be extremely interesting to study versions of those problems
in the presence of \emph{uncertainty} for the proposed interventions.

\ag{fairness-aware pagerank?}



\subsubsection*{Research theme 3: Diversity and fairness in information markets}


\subsubsection*{4.2.~~~Time plan and implementation}

\instructions{
Describe summarily the time plan for the project during the grant period, 
and how the project will be implemented. 
Describe also any crucial risks or obstacles that may impact on the implementation, 
and your plan for managing these.}

\spara{Time planning.}
The project will employ three doctoral students (PhD1, PhD2, PhD3) for five years each 
(working 80\% in research and 20\% as teaching assistants, as it is typical in KTH), 
and three postdoctoral researchers (PostD1, PostD2, PostD3) for two years each. 
The doctoral students will be recruited on years 1, 2, and 3 of the project, 
and the postdocs will be recruited on years 2, 3, and 4. 
One doctoral student and one postdoctoral researcher will work on each one of the research themes,
so the timeline of the project with respect to research themes and personnel is as follows:
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{description}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-4pt}
\item[1.~~{\exploration}\,:] 
PhD1 starting on year 1, PostD1 starting on year 2;
\item[2.~~{\networks}\,:]
PhD2 starting on year 2, PostD2 starting on year 3;
\item[3.~~{\markets}\,:]
PhD3 starting on year 3, PostD3 starting on year 4;
\end{description}
\vspace{-2mm}
The rationale is for \exploration to start first to study 
fundamental concepts of diversity and fairness that can be employed in the other two themes.
\markets will start last, as it has the highest level of ambition, novelty, and risk.
For each theme, the postdoc will start at the second year of the doctoral student, 
to be present in the most formative time of the student while skipping the first year when 
the students are still get adjusted and take courses.

\spara{Research output.}
We will aim publishing our work at top-tier international venues
in the areas of Knowledge Discovery, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
We will focus on the quality of publications rather than quantity.
Target journals for disseminating our work are IEEE TKDE, ACM TKDD, DMKD, etc. 
Target conferences are NeurIPS, ICML, VLDB, SIGMOD, SIGKDD, WebConf, WSDM, etc.

\spara{Materials.}
Our publications will be available via open access, 
in particular they will be shared via the {\small\url{arxiv.org}} repository. 
Similarly, the software we will develop and the other outputs of the project 
will become freely available to the scientific community via {\small\url{github.com}}.

\spara{Risks and mitigation.}
Devising efficient algorithms with provable quality guarantees is a challenging task
and the largest risk of the project. 
Achieving this objective, however, offers the largest potential for scientific impact in the computer science community. 
In cases that we will not be able to prove theoretical results, 
we will study problems with simplifying assumptions, and 
we will focus on devising heuristic methods and providing thorough empirical validation.

\subsubsection*{4.3.~~~Project organization}

\instructions{

as project leader is suitable for the task, 
including the relationship with your other research undertakings.}

\subsection*{5.~~~Need for research infrastructure}

\instructions{

The project is structured in three {\em research thrusts}:
\discover, \explore, and \recommend.
Each thrust specifies a research domain within the project
and a set of concrete problems with common motivation and common vision.
While to a large extent the problems within each thrust can be studied independently, 
there are also strong connections and feedback from one thrust will be used to obtain 
higher-quality results in the other.
The structure of the project is shown in Figure~\ref{figure:structure}.
In addition to the problems we will study within each thrust, 
we also show the computational methods that we will employ. 
% use to obtain solutions for these problems. 

\smallskip
With respect to methods, 
emphasis will be given to combinatorial algorithms,
building on the previous work of the PI 
on developing combinatorial methods for data-mining problems.
In particular, we will consider techniques such as 
combinatorial optimization, 
optimization of submodular functions, 
local-search methods, 
greedy algorithms, 
dynamic pro\-gram\-ming, 
linear-pro\-gram\-ming and semi\-def\-ini\-te-pro\-gram\-ming relaxations, 
primal-dual methods, convex optimization, etc. 
In addition, to deal with the stochastic nature of the data 
we will develop probabilistic models and algorithms that handle uncertainty.
We will also focus on designing scalable methods, 
by applying techniques based on sampling and sketching. 
The project also requires expertise on text analysis, 
natural-language processing, visualization, and user studies. 
These needs will be covered by hiring postdoctoral researchers with relevant expertise.

\smallskip
Next we overview the three research thrusts of \acronym.

\subsubsection*{Research thrust 1: \discover}

\noindent
\hspace{-3mm}\colorbox{verylightmagenta}{
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
In this research thrust we will develop novel computational methods 
to discover patterns and structure related to 
bias, polarization, conflict, and information silos in online media.
We will focus on mining se\-man\-ti\-cal\-ly-annotated graphs
with information extracted by text analysis, 
mining dynamic and temporal networks, 
and understanding the roles of individuals 
during the information-dissemination process. 
\end{minipage}}

\medskip
This thrust builds strongly on our preliminary work.
In particular, we have considered the problem 
of identifying controversial discussions on social media.% ~\cite{garimella2018quantifying}.
Our methods are designed to be applicable to topics in any domain 
(e.g., political, economical, or cultural), and in a general setting.
We have also addressed the question of devising a measure of controversy,
which is applicable to any online discussion.
More recently we devised a new study aimed to 
understand the phenomenon of echo chambers in social media, 
and to characterize distinct user types and their role in their local community. %~\cite{garimella2018political}.

\smallskip
In this project we will extend significantly our problem representations
so as to obtain a deeper analysis and develop much more advanced knowledge-discovery methods.
In particular, our existing work relies on analyzing plain graphs
with no additional information regarding text or time. 
In \acronym\ we will incorporate text information into the mining process.
We will develop methods to extract semantic annotations from the textual data, 
such as
($i$) agreement between users; 
($ii$) political leaning of users or content items; 
($iii$) stance with respect to topics; 
and so on.
We will use this information to enrich our graph models,
provide novel formulations for mining semantically-annotated graphs, 
and then design efficient algorithms.

\smallskip
As an example, we will consider discussion graphs
where edges are annotated with agreement (`$+$') or disagreement (`$-$'), 
and thus, represented as {\em signed graphs}.
In this setting we will consider the problems of discovering alliances 
(dense subgraphs with many `$+$' and few `$-$' edges) 
or conflicting communities
(sets of vertices with many `$+$' and few `$-$' within sets and many `$-$' and few `$+$' across sets). 
These are novel problems related to dense-subgraph discovery
% ~\cite{rozenshtein2014event,sozio2010community-search,tatti2015density,tsourakakis2013denser}
and correlation clustering. % ~\cite{bansal2004correlation,gionis2007clustering}.

\smallskip
We will also leverage the temporal dimension of the data
and study formulations that allow to model and discover 
bias, polarization, and conflict in the setting of temporal networks.
This thread will make strong connections with our previous work on 
temporal networks.
% ~\cite{rozenshtein2016temporal, rozenshtein2016reconstructing, rozenshtein2017finding}
Finally we will consider problem representations  
related to motif discovery
% ~\cite{aslay2018mining,coletto2017motif} 
and role mining.
% ~\cite{arockiasamy2016combinatorial} 
in the context of \acronym.

\subsubsection*{Research thrust 2: \explore}

\noindent
\hspace{-3mm}\colorbox{verylightmagenta}{
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
In this research thrust we will develop methods to help users 
understand better the global information landscape with respect to topics of their interest, 
visualize stories with annotations about different viewpoints, and 
increase their awareness about existing bias in the content they consume.
\end{minipage}}

\medskip
The underlying idea here is to allow users to visualize their content consumption
so that they become aware of possible biases in their ``news diet.'' 
At the same time we want to provide them the capability to visualize 
a more wide spectrum of information regarding a topic,
and support them explore alternative viewpoints.
Our preliminary work in this thrust
includes a novel method for inferring political-leaning scores
for user accounts and content sources in social media, 
in a completely unsupervised manner. %~\cite{lahoti2018joint}.
Those scores can be used in a number of different applications
involving information-retrieval tasks or content visualization and exploration.

\smallskip
In \acronym\ we will push this direction significantly beyond the state of the art. 
We will develop methods that produce comprehensive and understandable summaries 
of topics of interest discussed in online media. 
Our story summaries will contain information regarding the timeline of relevant events, 
important actors, entities, or concepts involved in the story, 
key persons participating in the discussion, and 
pointers to informative content. 
The summaries we will produce will allow users to understand
($i$) how polarized is a given topic;
($ii$) what is the spectrum of opinions about the topic;
($iii$) who are the most authoritative actors supporting a given opinion; 
($iv$) what is best available content for that opinion;
($v$) what is the bias/position of media outlets regarding a topic; 
and so on. 
In addition, our framework will allow users to visualize their own position in the opinion space
based on the content they have been exposed, 
their interaction with other users, and the content they have shared.

\smallskip
Finally, leveraging our framework for exploration and interaction 
% with content presented to the users, 
we will develop methods to learn the probability 
that a certain user is interested in exploring a given information item.
These probabilities will be used to optimize relevance of recommendations
in the third~thrust.


\subsubsection*{Research thrust 3: \recommend}

\noindent
\hspace{-3mm}\colorbox{verylightmagenta}{
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
In this research thrust we will 
develop recommendation algorithms that aim to increase the overall diversity in the network and 
balance information exposure of conflicting views. 
We will also investigate the effect of different features 
to the willingness of the users to explore viewpoints that conflict their opinion.
\end{minipage}}

\medskip
Again, this thrust is strongly based on our preliminary results.
In one of our most recent works we considered the problem of 
selecting a set of representative content items
(such as, news articles with varying opinions on a given topic)
to summarize a larger set of items. %~\cite{consensus-k-median}. 
This is a standard clustering problem, 
but in addition we require to select representative items
that are close to each other,
and thus, they are not polarized.
For the resulting problem we are able to provide scalable
algorithms with approximation guarantees
and show practical relevance in the application scenario
of selecting non-polarized representatives.

\smallskip
Additionally, we have studied the setting where
we ask to make relevant recommendations to users, 
which however have positive externalities to the whole network.
In particular,
we have addressed the problems
of balancing information exposure of different viewpoints in the network,
% ~\cite{garimella2017balancing},
and maximizing network diversity, 
where diversity is measured in different ways.
% ~\cite{diversity-cascade,diversity-static}.

\smallskip
In \acronym\ we will advance the state of the art in many directions.
First, we will enrich our networks with semantic annotations 
and will address recommendation problems in more realistic models. 
We will relax our assumptions and we will consider settings with multiple viewpoints, 
continuous polarity scores, 
and more complex information-propagation models.
We will study novel recommendation problems, 
and will seek to resolve open problems in our current problem formulations.

\subsection*{Section c. Timeliness, feasibility, and contingency planning}

As it is becoming apparent that social-media platforms have many adverse consequences,
including bias, polarization, conflict, and creation of information silos, 
and as stakeholders are raising their voices to get those problems fixed, 
achieving viable solutions will require cooperation among companies, policy makers, 
and scientists in multiple disciplines, including academic computer scientists. 
In this respect, the project is extremely timely.

\smallskip 
The PI is in a unique position to accomplish the goals of the project. 
His profile brings together 
the\-o\-ret\-i\-cal work on algorithms design,
with development of practical data-mining methods, 
and strong emphasis on applications.
The practical aspect is further enhanced by a six-year experience in industrial research 
(Yahoo!\ Research)
and a network of collaborators in big social-media companies.
The PI is leading a research team of seven people, 
has been successful in international recruitment, 
and his doctoral students have acquired internship positions in companies
like Google, Facebook, Amazon, LinkedIn, etc.
Recent graduates are currently working in Google, EPFL, 
and University of Helsinki (assistant professor).

\smallskip 
The PI and his research team have pioneered a line of work on the project theme
and have obtained several preliminary results.
% ~\cite{diversity-cascade,garimella2017reducing,garimella2017balancing,garimella2018quantifying,lahoti2018joint,diversity-static}.
The objective of this project is to advance the state of the art in this important topic
on multiple fronts. 
In particular, we aim to work on more realistic models, 
achieve stronger algorithmic results, 
and resolve open problems. 
We also aim to enlarge and strengthen the team with researchers of complementary skills, 
and establish collaborations with industrial partners and scientists in other disciplines.
Without the support of this project it will not be possible to accomplish these ambitious goals.

\smallskip 
The research team has strong experience in collecting data from platforms like twitter and reddit, 
and much of our recent work has built on extensive data gathering.
In addition, we will seek to establish collaborations with international online-media companies
so that we can test our methods on real-world scenarios. 
We will also will seek collaboration with local media companies in Helsinki, 
such as
Yle (Finland's national public broadcasting company)
and Sanoma (a leading media group in the Nordic countries).


\mpara{Risks.}
\acronym\ sets ambitious goals and has high potential, 
but at the same time it contains significant risks.
One of our risks is the possibility 
that a majority of people prefer to receive biased content
and are not interested to explore conflicting viewpoints.
This would be an in\-ter\-est\-ing finding for the project.
In this case, our knowledge-discovery methods will still be useful, 
but many of the the tools we will build they will be of interest to a smaller population.
A second risk is that we will not be successful in devising 
algorithms with quality guarantees for the most challenging problems. 
In this case, we will make simplifying assumptions and 
focus on devising heuristic methods. 
A third risk is that we will not be able to establish high-profile industrial collaborations. 
In this case, we will perform our analysis on datasets we will collect, 
or public datasets, and will evaluate our algorithms using user studies.
