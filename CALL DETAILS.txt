    	State key references.
    Significance and scientific novelty. 
    	Describe briefly how the project relates to previous research within the area, and the impact the project may have in the short and long term. Describe also how the project moves forward or innovates the current research frontier.
    Project description. 
    	Describe the project design under the following headings:
        Theory and method: 
        	Describe the underlying theory and the methods to be applied in order to reach the project goal.

    Need for research infrastructure. 
    	Specify the projectâ€™s need for international and national research infrastructure. If you choose to use other infrastructures than those supported by the Swedish Research Council, and that are thereby open to all, you must justify this (also applies to local research infrastructure).
    International and national collaboration.
